# Cageusel

A simple, mobile-friendly carousel, dedicated to Nicholas Cage. ðŸ’–

## Purpose

I considered the routes I could go - do something familiar, look at others for direction, or try something completely new and different. I decided to use this challenge as a learning experience, to better understand how Custom Elements and native web components work.

### Requirements

1. 5 images, horizontal navigation
2. First image is initially selected
3. UI indicators to
   1. show the active slide
   2. navigate to a selected slide
4. Autoplay 4ever
5. Revolve images from either limit

### Features

All feature requirements [listed above](#Requirements) have been delivered. The design of this web component easliy allows for a satisfactory mobile experience.

### Gotchas

Browser compatibility is so important. It's something we (mostly) all care about. In this native implementation, however, I focused more on the learning experience and creating a stable, easily portable component. Run it in Chrome. Get an Android and run it in Chrome. Hell, run it in Firefox. But let's not go to that dark corner we call IE, let's just save that for later.
